Initial Setup:
1. Running git config --global user.email "bob@bob.com"
2. Running git config --global user.name "Bob Bob"
3. Create a private repository on github
4. Copy the URL for it (under code then click the green clipboard)
5. Git clone https://github.com/ShakaUVM/volleyball.git (or whatever the URL was)
6. Add a contributor (your partner, and they need to accept the invite) under settings
7. Get a Personal Access Token (under settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens)
 This is basically your password when you push to your repo, so write it down

Workflow:
1. git pull to get the latest version (only do this if there's changes on the repo)
2. Edit your files and get them working the way you like it
3. git add .
4. git commit -m "Change Message"
5. git push

Repeat steps 1 through 5 all the time

Recommend taking turns or working on different files to avoid merge conflicts
